# Campbeltown Loch Native Oyster Hatchery and Restoration Project

## Our Native Oysters

###### Keystone species

Described as a *keystone species*, Native Oysters both clean water and provide an environment for a whole ecosystem.

###### Geographical spread

Native oysters were once common around Scotland, the UK, coastal European countries and as far south as Morocco. 

###### Off our coast

Huge beds (possibly a billion) of native oysters were also found in the waters off the east coast of Kintyre and in Campbeltown Loch. 

###### The collapse 

Within 100 years, more than 95% of all Native Oysters have gone, and they are functionally extinct in Kintyre.

###### Impact

In temperate climates, like the UK, native oyster beds play a role similar to tropical coral reefs. And like coral reefs, when native oyster beds collapse, all the species that utilise that environment also disappear. This leaves barren expanses, poorer water quality and, in the main, only transient species. 

# Our aims

* Restore native oysters to Campbeltown Loch and surrounding waters
* Supply oyster seed for restoration nationally and internationally

# Goals
 
1. Establish a native oyster hatchery
1. Self-sustaining native oyster population in Campbeltown Loch 
 
# Loch restoration feasibility study 
 
A feasibility study was proposed to achieve a self-sustaining population in the Loch.
