# Our Native Oysters

###### Geographical spread

Described as a keystone species, Native Oysters both clean water and provide an environment for a whole ecosystem. Native oysters were once common around Scotland, UK, coastal European countries and as far south as Morocco. 

###### Off our coast

Huge beds (possibly a billion) of native oysters were also common in the waters in and around Campbeltown Loch. 

###### The collapse 

Within 100 years 90% of all Native Oysters have gone.

###### Impact

In temperate climates, like the UK, native oyster beds play a role similar to tropical coral reefs. And like coral reefs, when native oyster beds collapse then all the species that utilised that environment also disappear. This leaves barren expanses, poorer water quality and, in the main, only transient species. 

# Our aims

* Restore native oysters to Cambeltown Loch and surrounding waters
* Supply oyster seed for restoration nationally and internationally
