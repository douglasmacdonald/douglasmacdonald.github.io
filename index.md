# Our Native Oysters

Huge beds of native oysters were once common in the waters in and around Campbeltown Loch. Described as a keystone species, they both clean water and provide 
an environment for a whole ecosystem.

# Our aims

* Restore native oysters to Cambeltown Loch and surrounding waters
* Supply oyster seed for restoration nationally and internationally

# The slow collapse 

In temperate climates, like the UK, native oyster beds play a role similar to tropical coral reefs. And like coral reefs, when native oyster beds collapse then all the other species that utilised that environment also disappear. This leaves barren expanses, poorer water quality and, in the main, only transient species.
