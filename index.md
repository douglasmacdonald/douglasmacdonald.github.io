# Our Native Oysters

###### Keystone species

Described as a *keystone species*, Native Oysters both clean water and provide an environment for a whole ecosystem.

###### Geographical spread

Native oysters were once common around Scotland, UK, coastal European countries and as far south as Morocco. 

###### Off our coast

Huge beds (possibly a billion) of native oysters were also found in the waters off the east coast of Kintyre and in Campbeltown Loch. 

###### The collapse 

Within 100 years more than 95% of all Native Oysters have gone and in Kintyre they are functionally extinct.

###### Impact

In temperate climates, like the UK, native oyster beds play a role similar to tropical coral reefs. And like coral reefs, when native oyster beds collapse then all the species that utilised that environment also disappear. This leaves barren expanses, poorer water quality and, in the main, only transient species. 

# Our aims

* Restore native oysters to Cambeltown Loch and surrounding waters
* Supply oyster seed for restoration nationally and internationally

# Goals
 
1. Establish native oyster hatchery
1. Self sustaining native oyster population in Campbletown Loch 
 
# Loch restoration feasibility study 
 
To reach the goal of a self sustaining population in the Loch its feasibility study was carried out.
