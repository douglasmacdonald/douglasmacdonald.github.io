# Our aims

Huge beds of native oysters were once common in the waters in and around Campbeltown Loch. Described as a keystone species, they both clean the water and provide an environment for a whole ecosystem.

* Restore native oysters to Cambeltown Loch and surrounding waters
* Supply oyster seed for restoration nationally and internationally

# The slow collapse 

In temperate climates, like the UK, native oyster beds play a role similar to tropical coral reefs.
